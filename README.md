- WARNING: THE CODE IS ONLY AN EDUCATIONAL PROJECT, THERE IS *NO* SECURITY OR PRIVACY FEATURES INBUILT. ONCE IT GOES FULLY PUBLIC, DO NOT IN ANY SCENARIO INPUT YOUR ACTUALLY EMAIL, USERNAME, PASSWORD, BANK DETAILS AND ANY OTHER SENSITIVE DATA.

- This is a small project I have been working on in order to widen my understanding on networks and the internet in general
- It consists of not only the client code publizied now but a custom DNS code [THIS WILL NEVER BE RELEASED DUE ETHICAL CONCERNS] and a custom HTTP server [THIS WILL BE RELEASED]
- The HTTP server, client and DNS are linked in order to allow users to access many different websites, once the code is public and many HTTP server are running it will become a mini internet of sorts.
- HTTP SERVER
    - Once HTTP server code is fully ready it will released to allow people to host their websites on the network
    - HOWEVER: in order to get your server IP added to the DNS you must email [THE EMAIL WILL BE WRITTEN IN THE CODE] the:
      - 1) IP hosting the server
      - 2) The *ENTIRE* code of the wesbite.
      - 3) The main funtion of your website
    - This is being done so that any unethical websites can be prevented from being hosted and accesed.
    - If the IP of the server does change then email the new Ip, via the *SAME EMAIL* and provide both the "URL" - must end in ".mali" and the "ip"

- NEXT UPDATE
  - Allow html files to use <style> and <script> tags
  - Allow websites to be interactive
