- This is a little project I have been working on trying to make my own network, with a webbrowser and html transfer capabilities and eventually I will release the HTTP server hosting code online once it is ready so that people can host their own websites aswel, making it a internet of somesort.
- It consists of not only the client code publizied now but a custom DNS code [THIS WILL NEVER BE RELEASED DUE ETHICAL CONCERNS] and a custom HTTP server [THIS WILL BE RELEASED]
- HTTP SERVER
    - Once HTTP server code is fully ready it will released to allow people to host their websites on the network
    - HOWEVER: in order to get your server IP added to the DNS you must email [THE EMAIL WILL BE WRITTEN IN THE CODE] the:
      - 1) IP hosting the server
      - 2) The *ENTIRE* code of the wesbite.
      - 3) The main funtion of your website
    - This is being done so that any unethical websites can be prevented from being hosted and accesed.
    - If the IP of the server does change then email the new Ip, via the *SAME EMAIL*

- NEXT UPDATE
  - Allow html files to use <style> and <script> tags
  - Allow websites to be interactive
